# Few-Shot-Learning-Using-Prototypical-Networks-with-various-attentional-modules
This summer project focuses incorporating various attentional modules such as Squeeze and Excitation Network(SENet),Convolutional Bottleneck Attentional Module(CBAM),Efficient Channel Attention(ECA) Net into the prototypical network backbone suggested by Jake Snell et al.  
There are notebooks for various attentional modules along with their loss and accuracy scores.
The datasets used in this projects are
* Omniglot
* MiniImageNet
* Tiered Image Net
